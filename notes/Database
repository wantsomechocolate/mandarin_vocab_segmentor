Texts
For texts that people paste in, the text itself, should I store them as files? Maybe even store them as files in the person's cache
I think I want to try storing the pasted text in database fields, this isn't for pasting in entire books, and people can go chapter by chapter anyway, whats the point of a 1000 word vocab list. 

User, Text, Length, 1 Char Tokens, 2 Char Tokens, 3 Char Tokens, 4 Char Tokens, 5 Char Tokens, 6 Char Tokens......
Algorithm (longest matching), Word
