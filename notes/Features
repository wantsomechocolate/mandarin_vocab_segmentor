So the thing that would really be helpful is the ability to filter out words you already know.
The plan for me is to just assign a percentage to all the words that I know so that I can automatically exclude them from vocab lists
generated by stuff
That way I don't need an arbitrary cutoff on the frequency list

though I think a lower bound cutoff is still useful. 

I also need to make a decision on whether or not to include all of the 1 million rows or not in their original form. 
I also need to update my algorithm to not require bridge words, or update my algorithm to use a trie?

I think that might actually be a good idea.
