lets say are start with 
干事

I know it's the first letter so I add it with the null parent IF I don't find it as a key

Then I make the parent the current node and ssee if it contains the current key (second char)





Initialize root node
parent will stay null
is word will stay false
children will be an empty dictionary

for each word, start with root node and look through all the letters in the word, keeping track of the word up to that point. 

parent_node = root_node

for i in word.length.times
	node = new Node()
	node.parent = parent_node
	node.is_word = global_dict.contains(word[0,i+1])
	node.children = {}

	## make this a child of the previous node

	if parent_node.children.has_key?(word[i])
		## this child already exists so just set the new parent to it
		parent_node = parent_node.children[word[i]]
	else
		## you need to add the child node to the parent, and then set it
		parent_node.children[word[i]] = node
		parent_node = node
